In this project, you can manipulate a Rubik's Cube.

Controller controls (works better):
- left and right stick to control the camera
- d-pad and a to control which side of the cube to rotate
- left and right trigger to rotate a face
- select to scramble


Keyboard controls:
- mouse to control the camera (mouse wheel for rotating around the roll axis)
- arrow keys and shift to control which side of the cube to rotate
- page up to turn the face clockwise / page down for anti-clockwise
- escape to unlock mouse focus
- r to scramble

(controls work according to the Rubik's Cube move notation - I think)
